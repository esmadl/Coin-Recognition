# Coin-Recognition

This is a program that recognizes Turkish coins using OpenCV. This program works with photos taken in A5 size. 
Define an A5 size paper or area and set the camera to include the specified area. Place any coin you want in this area and take a photo, 
saving it to your computer. Then run the ui.py file. Click the 'Browser' button and select the photo you took. Then press the 'Run' button.
On the left side, you will see the identified coins, and on the right side you will see how many coins of each type there are and the total amount 
of the coins.
